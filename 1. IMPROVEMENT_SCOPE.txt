Performance Optimization in React Components
To enhance the performance of our React components, consider utilizing strategies such as useCallback, useMemo, React.memo, Lazy Loading with React.lazy and Suspense, as well as useDeferredValue. These optimizations can reduce unnecessary re-renders and improve responsiveness, leading to a more efficient application.

Deployment and CI/CD with Docker
I noticed the absence of a Dockerfile for deployment. Providing this would streamline containerization and set the foundation for continuous integration and deployment processes (CI/CD), ensuring smooth and consistent deployment pipelines.

Continuous Integration for Database
A continuous integration script for the database setup appears to be missing. Implementing this would greatly assist in maintaining database schema consistency across environments and support automated migrations, aligning with best practices for development and deployment.

Organized Data Management with ORM or Stored Procedures
For a more structured and maintainable approach to database management, I recommend adopting either an ORM or stored procedures (SP). Using these tools can help to standardize our data operations, making the codebase more organized, readable, and easier to maintain.

Server-Side Framework Recommendation: NestJS
I recommend considering a shift to NestJS as the server-side framework. Its popularity and robust TypeScript support make it well-suited for modern application development, promoting organized, modular code with a consistent structure.
